# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `bi-agentic-flow`
3. Description: `Business Intelligence Agentic Flow - Multi-source analytics with autonomous agents`
4. Choose: **Public** (or Private if preferred)
5. **Do NOT initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Push Local Repository

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/robinwalker/ai-projects/bi-agentic-flow

# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/rwalkerphl/bi-agentic-flow.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Repository
- Visit your repository URL: `https://github.com/rwalkerphl/bi-agentic-flow`
- Confirm all files are uploaded correctly
- Check that README.md displays properly

## 📋 Current Repository Contents

```
bi-agentic-flow/
├── README.md                    # Project overview and documentation
├── requirements.txt             # Python dependencies
├── config/

│   └── crewai_migration.md     # CrewAI migration framework
├── .gitignore                   # Git ignore rules
└── SETUP.md                     # This file
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

After GitHub setup is complete, we'll continue with:

1. **MVP Development**: Create the core orchestrator and agents
2. **Streamlit Dashboard**: Build the visualization layer
3. **Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflow
4. **Documentation**: Add architecture and API docs
5. **CrewAI Migration**: Implement production framework

## 🤝 Collaboration

Once the repository is public:
- Share the repository URL for collaboration
- Use GitHub Issues for feature requests and bugs
- Create Pull Requests for new features
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD (future enhancement)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that your GitHub credentials are configured: `git config --global user.name` and `git config --global user.email`
2. Ensure you have push access to the repository
3. Verify the remote URL is correct: `git remote -v`
